# Hackathon Leaderboard

This is the react + firebase app for the NEAR hackathon leaderboard.

## Development
For dev
`npm start` to launch the hot reloader and do some cool stuff. Go to `localhost:8080` to see it in action.

For prod build
`npm run build`

## NOTE
  For firebase to work, you need a config object that is stored in `src/fire.js`. This is notably missing from the public repo. You can use this with any firebase project by dropping the default config and init into `fire.js`.

TODO:
- Get firebase to work...
- Add users and auth
- Add Admin dash for adding points
